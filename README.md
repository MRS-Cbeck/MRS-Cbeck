## 👋 Hey there, I'm Cory Beck!

## 🖥️ System Administrator | 🛠️ Automation Enthusiast | 🎮 Tech Tinkerer

I'm currently the **System Administrator and Automation Expert** at **Metal Rollforming Systems**. 
My day-to-day involves:

- Helping users install and troubleshoot software 🛠️
- Diagnosing and resolving system errors ⚡
- Automating workflows to make life easier 🤖

I love writing scripts to **automate repetitive tasks**, even if it would take less time to just do it manually--because learning is half the fun!

## 🎯 What I Bring to the Table
✅ **Automationg & Scripting** - Powershell, Python, and whatever else makes life easier
✅ **IT Support & Troubleshooting** - If it's broken, I'll figure it out
✅ **UX/UI & Communication Design** - Degree from EWU with a focus on making things both functional & beautiful
✅ **Tech Education & Support** - Whether you need it done *for* you or want to learn *how* to do it, I've got you covered

## 🎮 When I'm Not Fixing Things...

Outside of work, you'll probably find me:
🏕️ Camping in the great outdoors
🎮 Playing video games (*when time permits!*)
🎯 Tossing bags in a game of cornhole
🏉 Jumping into a pickup game of rugby

If you're into **automation, IT, or just making tech work smarter,** let's connect! 🚀
